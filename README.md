This second tutorial will guide you through integrating YARP with OpenCV while getting live image streams.

The task at hand is to correctly detect a red ball from images from a dataset streamed through a port.

The dataset is currently available on the provided virtual environment. Otherwise, it can be downloaded following these simple steps:
```sh
$ wget http://www.icub.org/download/software/datasetplayer-demo/testData_20120803_095402.zip
$ unzip testData_20120803_095402.zip
```
Finally, create the env var `DATASETS_PATH` pointing to the location where you've unzipped the archieve.
